This Python script facilitates the setting of personalized alarms by users, prompting them to specify a time and a corresponding descriptive message. Leveraging threading, it continuously checks the current time against the user-defined alarm time, triggering a notification and a sound playback upon match. This implementation enhances user experience and productivity by enabling timely reminders and notifications in various scenarios.
